PedestrianTrack Project

üèÅ Project Overview

The PedestrianTrack project aims to analyze pedestrian movement patterns using a combination of feature engineering and machine learning. The goal is to classify different pedestrian behaviors based on spatial and motion data.

# Conclusion
The pedestrian tracking project successfully achieved its objective of predicting pedestrian interactions using geospatial and time-series data. After extensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an impressive .97% accuracy. This high accuracy demonstrates the model's strong ability to capture complex patterns in pedestrian movements and interactions with surrounding objects.
The model‚Äôs performance on unseen data, consistently predicting [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], suggests a high confidence in classifying that specific interaction type. However, this also raises a potential point for further analysis ‚Äî whether the model generalizes well across all classes or overfits to a dominant class.
The project highlights the strength of ensemble methods like Random Forest in handling noisy, multidimensional data, especially when dealing with a mix of spatial, temporal, and categorical features. While the results are promising, future work could focus on:
Expanding the dataset to include more diverse pedestrian scenarios and environmental contexts.
Handling class imbalances to ensure the model performs equally well across all interaction types.
Integrating real-time tracking to test the model in dynamic, live environments.Refining feature engineering to extract more insightful patterns from orientation metrics and object proximity.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the potential of machine learning to improve pedestrian behavior analysis, supporting applications in urban planning, public safety, and smart city development.
