PedestrianTrack Project

🏁 Project Overview

The PedestrianTrack project aims to analyze pedestrian movement patterns using a combination of feature engineering and machine learning. The goal is to classify different pedestrian behaviors based on spatial and motion data.

📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key features:

timestamp: Time in seconds for each observation.

x, y: Coordinates representing pedestrian position.

other_x, other_y: Position of the nearest other object.

body_roll, body_pitch, body_yaw: Body orientation angles.

head_roll, head_pitch, head_yaw: Head orientation angles.

other_class: Target variable representing pedestrian behavior class.
